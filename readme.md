# gh-pages

Publish files to a `gh-pages` branch on GitHub (or any other branch anywhere else).

## Getting Started

```shell
npm install gh-pages --save-dev
```

This module requires Git >= 1.9 and Node > 14.

## Basic Usage

```js
var ghpages = require('gh-pages');

ghpages.publish('dist', function(err) {});
```


## `publish`

```js
ghpages.publish(dir, callback);
// or...
ghpages.publish(dir, options, callback);
```

Calling this function will create a temporary clone of the current repository, create a `gh-pages` branch if one doesn't already exist, copy over all files from the base path, or only those that match patterns from the optional `src` configuration, commit all changes, and push to the `origin` remote.

If a `gh-pages` branch already exists, it will be updated with all commits from the remote before adding any commits from the provided `src` files.

**Note** that any files in the `gh-pages` branch that are *not* in the `src` files **will be removed**.  See the [`add` option](#optionsadd) if you don't want any of the existing files removed.


### <a id="dir">`dir`</a>
* type: `string`

The base directory for all source files (those listed in the `src` config property).

Example use:

```js
/**
 * Given the following directory structure:
 *
 *   dist/
 *     index.html
 *     js/
 *       site.js
 *
 * The usage below will create a `gh-pages` branch that looks like this:
 *
 *   index.html
 *   js/
 *     site.js
 *
 */
ghpages.publish('dist', callback);
```


### Options

The default options work for simple cases.  The options described below let you push to alternate branches, customize your commit messages and more.


#### <a id="optionssrc">options.src</a>
 * type: `string|Array<string>`
 * default: `'**/*'`

The [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) pattern or array of patterns is used to select which files should be published.


#### <a id="optionsbranch">options.branch</a>
 * type: `string`
 * default: `'gh-pages'`
 * `-b | --branch <branch name>`

The name of the branch you'll be pushing to.  The default uses GitHub's `gh-pages` branch, but this can be configured to push to any branch on any remote.

Example use of the `branch` option:

```js
/**
 * This task pushes to the `master` branch of the configured `repo`.
 */
ghpages.publish('dist', {
  branch: 'master',
  repo: 'https://example.com/other/repo.git'
}, callback);
```


#### <a id="optionsdest">options.dest</a>
 * type: `string`
 * default: `'.'`

The destination folder within the destination branch.  By default, all files are published to the root of the repository.

Example use of the `dest` option:

```js
/**
 * Place content in the static/project subdirectory of the target
 * branch.
 */
ghpages.publish('dist', {
  dest: 'static/project'
}, callback);
```

#### <a id="optionsdotfiles">options.dotfiles</a>
 * type: `boolean`
 * default: `false`

Include dotfiles.  By default, files starting with `.` are ignored unless they are explicitly provided in the `src` array.  If you want to also include dotfiles that otherwise match your `src` patterns, set `dotfiles: true` in your options.

Example use of the `dotfiles` option:

```js
/**
 * The usage below will push dotfiles (directories and files)
 * that otherwise match the `src` pattern.
 */
ghpages.publish('dist', {dotfiles: true}, callback);
```


#### <a id="optionsadd">options.add</a>
 * type: `boolean`
 * default: `false`

Only add, and never remove existing files.  By default, existing files in the target branch are removed before adding the ones from your `src` config.  If you want the task to add new `src` files but leave existing ones untouched, set `add: true` in your options.

Example use of the `add` option:

```js
/**
 * The usage below will only add files to the `gh-pages` branch, never removing
 * any existing files (even if they don't exist in the `src` config).
 */
ghpages.publish('dist', {add: true}, callback);
```


#### <a id="optionsrepo">options.repo</a>
 * type: `string`
 * default: url for the origin remote of the current dir (assumes a git repository)
 * `-r | --repo <repo url>`

By default, `gh-pages` assumes that the current working directory is a git repository, and that you want to push changes to the `origin` remote.

If instead your script is not in a git repository, or if you want to push to another repository, you can provide the repository URL in the `repo` option.

Example use of the `repo` option:

```js
/**
 * If the current directory is not a clone of the repository you want to work
 * with, set the URL for the repository in the `repo` option.  This usage will
 * push all files in the `src` config to the `gh-pages` branch of the `repo`.
 */
ghpages.publish('dist', {
  repo: 'https://example.com/other/repo.git'
}, callback);
```


#### <a id="optionsremote">options.remote</a>
 * type: `string`
 * default: `'origin'`

The name of the remote you'll be pushing to.  The default is your `'origin'` remote, but this can be configured to push to any remote.

Example use of the `remote` option:

```js
/**
 * This task pushes to the `gh-pages` branch of of your `upstream` remote.
 */
ghpages.publish('dist', {
  remote: 'upstream'
}, callback);
```


#### <a id="optionstag">options.tag</a>
 * type: `string`
 * default: `''`

Create a tag after committing changes on the target branch.  By default, no tag is created.  To create a tag, provide the tag name as the option value.


#### <a id="optionsmessage">options.message</a>
 * type: `string`
 * default: `'Updates'`

The commit message for all commits.

Example use of the `message` option:

```js
/**
 * This adds commits with a custom message.
 */
ghpages.publish('dist', {
  message: 'Auto-generated commit'
}, callback);
```


#### <a id="optionsuser">options.user</a>
 * type: `Object`
 * default: `null`

If you are running the `gh-pages` task in a repository without a `user.name` or `user.email` git config properties (or on a machine without these global config properties), you must provide user info before git allows you to commit.  The `options.user` object accepts `name` and `email` string values to identify the committer.

Example use of the `user` option:

```js
ghpages.publish('dist', {
  user: {
    name: 'Joe Code',
    email: 'coder@example.com'
  }
}, callback);
```

#### <a id="optionsuser">options.remove</a>
 * type: `string`
 * default: `'.'`

Removes files that match the given pattern (Ignored if used together with
`--add`). By default, `gh-pages` removes everything inside the target branch
auto-generated directory before copying the new files from `dir`.

Example use of the `remove` option:

```js
ghpages.publish('dist', {
  remove: "*.json"
}, callback);
```


#### <a id="optionspush">options.push</a>
 * type: `boolean`
 * default: `true`

Push branch to remote.  To commit only (with no push) set to `false`.

Example use of the `push` option:

```js
ghpages.publish('dist', {push: false}, callback);
```


#### <a id="optionshistory">options.history</a>
 * type: `boolean`
 * default: `true`

Push force new commit without parent history.

Example use of the `history` option:

```js
ghpages.publish('dist', {history: false}, callback);
```


#### <a id="optionssilent">options.silent</a>
 * type: `boolean`
 * default: `false`

Avoid showing repository URLs or other information in errors.

Example use of the `silent` option:

```js
/**
 * This configuration will avoid logging the GH_TOKEN if there is an error.
 */
ghpages.publish('dist', {
  repo: 'https://' + process.env.GH_TOKEN + '@github.com/user/private-repo.git',
  silent: true
}, callback);
```


#### <a id="optionsbeforeadd">options.beforeAdd</a>
 * type: `function`
 * default: `null`

Custom callback that is executed right before `git add`.

The CLI expects a file exporting the beforeAdd function

```bash
gh-pages --before-add ./cleanup.js
```

Example use of the `beforeAdd` option:

```js
/**
 * beforeAdd makes most sense when `add` option is active
 * Assuming we want to keep everything on the gh-pages branch
 * but remove just `some-outdated-file.txt`
 */
ghpages.publish('dist', {
  add: true,
  async beforeAdd(git) {
    return git.rm('./some-outdated-file.txt');
  }
}, callback);
```


#### <a id="optionsgit">options.git</a>
 * type: `string`
 * default: `'git'`

Your `git` executable.

Example use of the `git` option:

```js
/**
 * If `git` is not on your path, provide the path as shown below.
 */
ghpages.publish('dist', {
  git: '/path/to/git'
}, callback);
```

## Command Line Utility

Installing the package creates a `gh-pages` command line utility.  Run `gh-pages --help` to see a list of supported options.

With a local install of `gh-pages`, you can set up a package script with something like the following:

```shell
"scripts": {
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
}
```

And then to publish everything from your `dist` folder to your `gh-pages` branch, you'd run this:

```shell
npm run deploy
```

## GitHub Pages Project Sites

There are three types of GitHub Pages sites: [project, user, and organization](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#types-of-github-pages-sites). Since project sites are not hosted on the root `<user|org>.github.io` domain and instead under a URL path based on the repository name, they often require configuration tweaks for various build tools and frameworks. If not configured properly, a browser will usually log `net::ERR_ABORTED 404` errors when looking for compiled assets.

Examples:
- Create React App (which uses webpack under the hood) [requires the user to set a `"homepage"` property in their `package.json` so that built assets are referenced correctly in the final compiled HTML](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#building-for-relative-paths).
  - This [has been often been thought of as an issue with `gh-pages`](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages/issues/285#issuecomment-805321474), though this package isn't able to control a project's build configuration.
- Vite [requires a `"base"` property in its `vite.config.js`](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html#github-pages)
- Next.js does not support deploying to GitHub Pages [because of an opinionated static export approach that puts all assets under a `_next` direcotry that GitHub Pages ignores](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/9460).

When using a project site, be sure to read the documentation for your particular build tool or framework to learn how to configure correct asset paths.

## Debugging

To get additional output from the `gh-pages` script, set `NODE_DEBUG=gh-pages`.  For example:

```shell
NODE_DEBUG=gh-pages npm run deploy
```

## Dependencies

Note that this plugin requires Git 1.9 or higher (because it uses the `--exit-code` option for `git ls-remote`).  If you'd like to see this working with earlier versions of Git, please [open an issue](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages/issues).

## Tips

### Fixing `branch already exists` errors
```
{ ProcessError: fatal: A branch named 'gh-pages' already exists.

    at ChildProcess.<anonymous> (~/node_modules/gh-pages/lib/git.js:42:16)
    at ChildProcess.emit (events.js:180:13)
    at maybeClose (internal/child_process.js:936:16)
    at Process.ChildProcess._handle.onexit (internal/child_process.js:220:5)
  code: 128,
  message: 'fatal: A branch named \'gh-pages\' already exists.\n',
  name: 'ProcessError' }
  ```

The `gh-pages` module writes temporary files to a `node_modules/.cache/gh-pages` directory.  The location of this directory can be customized by setting the `CACHE_DIR` environment variable.

If `gh-pages` fails, you may find that you need to manually clean up the cache directory.  To remove the cache directory, run `node_modules/gh-pages/bin/gh-pages-clean` or remove `node_modules/.cache/gh-pages`.

### Deploying to GitHub Pages with a custom domain

To use a custom domain, a CNAME file must be committed to the root of the branch (`gh-pages` by default) that contains your GitHub Pages content.
The CNAME file should have only one line: the hostname of your site's custom domain like `foo.helloworld.com`.
When you use your repo's Settings page in GitHub to set a custom domain, behind the scenes it is creating and committing a CNAME file to your current GitHub Pages branch.

Because `gh-pages` by default (unless the `add` and/or `remove` options are used) will remove the existing CNAME file, a CNAME file must be included in the build folder that is deployed every time `gh-pages` runs.
There are two ways to do this:

One way is to change your deplopymenet script to add a CNAME file to your build folder before running `gh-pages`.

```
echo your_cutom_domain.online > ./build/CNAME && gh-pages -d build"
```

The other way is to commit a CNAME file in a location where your build pipeline will copy that file into your build folder before it's deployed.
For example, if you use `gh-pages` for React app deployment then you can put put a CNAME file into your `public` folder.

### Deploying with GitHub Actions

In order to deploy with GitHub Actions, you will need to define a user and set the git repository for the process. See the example step below

```yaml
- name: Deploy with gh-pages
  run: |
    git remote set-url origin https://git:${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}.git
    npx gh-pages -d build -u "github-actions-bot <support+actions@github.com>"
   env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

The `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` is provided automatically as part of the GitHub Action and does not require any further configuration, but simply needs to be passed in as an environmental variable to the step. `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` is the owner and repository name and is also passed in automatically, but does not need to be added to the `env` list.

See [Issue #345](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages/issues/345) for more information

#### Deploying with GitHub Actions and a named script

If you are using a named script in the `package.json` file to deploy, you will need to ensure you pass the variables properly to the wrapped `gh-pages` script. Given the `package.json` script below:

```json
"scripts": {
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
}
```

You will need to utilize the `--` option to pass any additional arguments:

```yaml
- name: Deploy with gh-pages
  run: |
    git remote set-url origin https://git:${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}.git
    npm run deploy -- -u "github-actions-bot <support+actions@github.com>"
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

See [Pull Request #368](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages/pull/368) for more information.
